        <h2>Home Information</h2>
        <h3>Wi-Fi Information</h3>
        <p>Wi-Fi information will be provided on a piece of paper on the kitchen counter.</p>
        <h3>Smart Lock Information</h3>
        <p>Front Door has a smart lock with a keypad. You can unlock it from your phone, but you will need to download 
            the August app, which you can find by following the link here: <a href="https://august.com/pages/app">august.com/pages/app</a>.</p>
        <h3>Garage Information</h3>
        <p>Our garage door is also connected to the Wi-Fi, and can be opened/closed using the MyQ app, which you can find by following the link 
            here: <a href="https://www.myq.com/app">myq.com/app</a>.</p> 
        <p>We will share access with you during your stay, so you can park your car 
            in the garage if we have left the spot open for you. Otherwise, you can use the MyQ app to get inside if the front door lock's battery 
            dies while you're staying at our home.</p>
        <h3>Trash Days</h3>
        <p>Trash and recycling are both collected on the same day, Thursday early morning. Please put the trash and recycling bins 
            on the street, at least 4 feet apart from each other, on Wednesday night. The bins are located on the right side of the 
            house (when looking at the house from the street) on the front side of the house.</p>
        <h3>Plant Watering</h3>
        <p>There are a few different plants both inside and in the backyard. The hanging indoor plants are in the kitchen, and only need 
            to be watered every other week. There is also a violet plant next to the sink, and it only needs to be watered if the soil feels
            dry.</p>
        <p>The outdoor plants will need to be watered more frequently, roughly every two to three days, depending on how hot the weather has 
            been lately. There is a hose in the backyard that you can use to water all of the plants in the backyard. There are a few plants 
            in the covered patio area, and there is also a garden on the far side of the grass/turf.
        </p>
        <h3>Smart Home Information</h3>
        <p>Every room except for the guest bedroom is connected to Alexa for smart lighting. To turn on/off the lights 
            in that room just say “Alexa, turn on/off the [room name]”. Here is a list of the room names.</p>
        <ul class="body-list">
            <li>Master Bedroom</li>
            <li>Office</li>
            <li>Dining Room</li>
            <li>Kitchen</li>
            <li>Living Room</li>
            <li>Garage</li>
            <li>Backyard</li>
            <li>Upstairs (Master Bedroom and Office)</li>
            <li>Downstairs (Dining Room, Kitchen, Living Room, Garage)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Alexa is also connected to our music services, so feel free to have her play whatever songs you may want if 
            you so choose. Just say “Alexa, play [song/album/playlist/radio station] on the [group name]”. If you don't 
            specify a group, the music will play on only the device you're speaking to. If you want music to play on all 
            speakers at once, use “everywhere” as the group name.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there are a few automation routines that are set up in the home. For example, the kitchen has 
            a motion detector that will turn on the lights in the kitchen if motion is detected after 10:00 PM. The 
            lights will automatically turn off after 15 minutes. The garage lights will turn on automatically if the 
            garage door is opened and will stay on if no motion is detected in the garage for a few minutes. If the 
            lights don't automatically turn on, flick the light switch on and off a couple of times. The lights in 
            the living room should turn on around sunset each day, and will also turn off after midnight. Lastly, 
            the Master Bedroom has an occupancy sensor, and the lights turn on if you are in the room after sunset 
            and will also turn off if no one is in the room.</p>
        <p>Most of the TVs are connected to Alexa, so if you can't locate the remote you can ask Alexa to turn off 
            or turn on the Bedroom TV, Living Room TV, etc. All the TVs have some kind of streaming device. Your 
            room will have a Fire TV Stick and a TV remote. The TV remote will be needed for volume control and 
            power control. The Fire TV remote will be used for the streaming. We have most of the streaming services 
            and will ensure that you're logged in.</p>
        <p>The thermostat is also connected to Alexa, so if you want to adjust the A/C, just ask Alexa to set the 
            air conditioner to the desired temperature.</p>
