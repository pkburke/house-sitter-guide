        <h2>Pet Care Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Bandit and Smokey</h3>
                <p>Bandit free feeds with his food. He never overeats, so just add 3 scoops from his dog food container to his bowl 
                    and then refill it once his bowl is empty. His food is located in the garage, in the larger of the three food containers 
                    next to the washer and the water heater. His and Smokey's water fountain will need to be filled a few times during the day. 
                    You'll hear it once it starts to get too low.</p>
                <p>Smokey doesn't free feed like Bandit, but also doesn't always eat her food. We attempt to feed her once in the morning 
                    and once at night. She never overeats, so just add a few scoops from her dog food container to her bowl (smaller of 
                    the two bowls). If she doesn't finish her food, then take the bowl off the ground and put it out of reach from Bandit. 
                    Her food is located in the garage, in the middle in size of the three food containers, next to the washer and the water heater.</p>    
                <p>As long as the weather is below 90 degrees, please ensure that you walk Bandit and Smokey, or take them to the park once per day. 
                    Otherwise, you can take them for a 4-lap walk around the neighborhood once it is cool enough at night. 
                    If you can't wait for it to get very cool, make sure that you put on their boots. The harnesses, leashes, and boots are 
                    located in the hall closet/pantry.</p>
                <p>They will generally let you know when they needs to go outside to go to the bathroom. Generally, we let them out in the 
                    morning around 8:00 AM, and then as often as they need throughout the day, then once more before bedtime. As they goes 
                    to the bathroom fairly frequently, you may want to pick up the poops every other day. There is a scooper outside on the grass.</p>
                <p>Bandit and Smokey will sleep downstairs in the living room, just make sure that they have water, and give them each a bedtime treat. 
                    Bandit gets a tooth-cleaning treat, while Smokey gets a Duck treat. Both bags can be found in the hall closet/pantry, on the floor to the right.  
                    We usually leave the TV lights on for them, just ask Alexa â€œturn on the TV lights" and she'll turn them on.</p>
            <h3>Bella</h3>
                <p>Bella is fairly self-sufficient. Just make sure that her food bowl is not empty and that her water fountain 
                    is kept full. If it's low, it will turn off and flash red. Her food is located in a glass bowl in the office, 
                    but if that runs out there is more in the garage in the smallest of the three food containers.</p>
                <p>Bella's litter box will likely need to be cleaned once or twice during your stay. This will depend on how 
                    frequently she uses the box, but if you check and see a few poops, feel free to use the scooper and deposit 
                    them into a garbage bag (kept in the guest bathroom).</p>
                <p>Bella has free rein of the house and may sleep in our room, downstairs, etc. She may want to sleep with you, 
                    if you don't mind her doing so then leave your door open so she can come and go.</p>
