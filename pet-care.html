        <h2>Pet Care Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Bandit</h3>
        <p>Bandit free feeds with his food. He never overeats, so just add 3 scoops from his dog food container to his bowl 
            and then refill it once his bowl is empty. His food is located in the garage, in the larger of the two food containers 
            next to the washer and the water heater. His water fountain will need to be filled a few times during the day. 
            You'll hear it once it starts to get too low.</p>
        <p>As long as the weather is below 90 degrees, please ensure that you walk Bandit or take him to the park once per day. 
            Otherwise, you can take him for a 4-lap walk around the neighborhood once it is cool enough at night. 
            If you can't wait for it to get very cool, make sure that you put on his boots. His harness, leash, and boots are 
            located in the hall closet/pantry.</p>
        <p>He will generally let you know when he needs to go outside to go to the bathroom. Generally, we let him out in the 
            morning around 8:00 AM, and then as often as he needs throughout the day, then once more before bedtime. As he goes 
            to the bathroom fairly frequently, you may want to pick up the poops every other day. There is a scooper outside on the grass.</p>
        <p>Bandit will sleep downstairs just make sure that he has water, and give him a bedtime tooth-cleaning treat. 
            We usually leave the TV lights on for him, just ask Alexa â€œturn on the TV lights" and she'll turn them on.</p>
        <h3>Bella</h3>
        <p>Bella is fairly self-sufficient. Just make sure that her food bowl is not empty and that her water fountain 
            is kept full. If it's low, it will turn off and flash red. Her food is located in a glass bowl in the office, 
            but if that runs out there is more in the garage in the smaller of the two food containers.</p>
        <p>Bella's litter box will likely need to be cleaned once or twice during your stay. This will depend on how 
            frequently she uses the box, but if you check and see a few poops, feel free to use the scooper and deposit 
            them into a garbage bag (kept in the guest bathroom).</p>
        <p>Bella has free rein of the house and may sleep in our room, downstairs, etc. She may want to sleep with you, 
            if you don't mind her doing so then leave your door open so she can come and go.</p>
